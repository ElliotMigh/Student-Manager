# Student Management App

## Description

The **Student Management App** is an Android application developed in Kotlin that allows users to efficiently manage student records. This app provides functionalities to add, update, and delete student information through a user-friendly interface. It employs the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture for a clean separation of concerns and utilizes **RxJava** for reactive programming, ensuring smooth and responsive user interactions.

## Features

- **Add Student**: Easily add new student records with relevant details.
- **Update Student**: Seamlessly update existing student information.
- **Delete Student**: Remove student records as needed.
- **API Integration**: Communicates with a backend API to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student data.
- **Reactive Programming**: Utilizes RxJava for handling asynchronous data streams and managing UI updates efficiently.
- **MVVM Architecture**: Follows the MVVM design pattern to enhance code maintainability and testability.

## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin**: The primary programming language for Android development.
- **Android SDK**: For building the Android application.
- **RxJava**: For implementing reactive programming and managing asynchronous tasks.
- **MVVM Architecture**: To separate the UI logic from business logic, making the app more modular and easier to test.
