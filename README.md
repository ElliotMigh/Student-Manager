# Student Management App

## Description

**Student Management App** is a modern Android application built in Kotlin that helps users efficiently manage student records. With a clean and intuitive interface, the app allows adding, updating, and deleting student information effortlessly.  

The app follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture, leveraging **ViewModel** and **LiveData** for lifecycle-aware data handling and reactive UI updates. Additionally, **RxJava** is used to handle asynchronous operations smoothly, ensuring a responsive and fluid user experience.

- **Delete Student**: Remove student records with confirmation dialogs.  
- **Reactive UI**: Utilizes **LiveData** and **RxJava** to automatically update the UI when data changes.  
- **API Integration**: Connects to a backend API to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.  
- **MVVM Architecture**: Separates UI and business logic for easier maintenance and testing.  

## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin**: Primary language for Android development.  
- **Android SDK**: Core platform for building the application.
